      "──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n",
      "📊 Telangana's higher diabetes prevalence (15.9%) and larger diabetic population (5.96 million) compared to national averages create a significant market opportunity. The state's relatively high per capita income (₹228K/year) and good health insurance coverage (60.8%) also contribute to this score.\n",
      "🎯 The commercial team should focus on Tier-2 cities, targeting the large diabetic population with targeted marketing campaigns starting six months prior to launch, leveraging digital channels and partnerships with local healthcare providers.\n",
      "⚠️  The biggest risk is the high competition from established players in the market, particularly in the insulin segment, which may lead to pricing pressure and slower adoption of the new drug.\n",
      "📋 Telangana offers an attractive commercial opportunity with an Opportunity Score of 46.9/100, driven by its large diabetic population and relatively high per capita income.\n"

      "======================================================================\n",
      "As the Executive Summary for DiabetaInsight, I am pleased to present the findings of our AI-powered market entry analysis for a new Type-2 diabetes drug launching in India. The scale of India's diabetes crisis is staggering, with a national average prevalence rate of 12.6% and a total diabetic population of 165.8 million. This presents a significant commercial opportunity for pharmaceutical companies looking to enter the Indian market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our methodology involved leveraging a range of data sources, including ICMR-INDIAB 2023 (Lancet), NFHS-5 (MoHFW GoI), NPPA Drug Prices June 2025, and RBI State Income Data. We utilized Llama 3, an AI engine deployed via Ollama, to analyze the data and generate an opportunity score for each of India's 30 states. This score takes into account both the disease burden and commercial viability in each state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our key findings reveal that Tamil Nadu ranks #1 with an opportunity score of 78.67, driven by a high disease burden and commercial viability. Goa, despite having only 1.5 million people, ranks #2 with an opportunity score of 63.44, thanks to its high per capita income. Maharashtra, India's financial capital, ranks #8 with a moderate disease burden and commercial viability. On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh, despite having a large population, ranks #15 due to a high disease burden but low commercial viability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on our findings, we recommend that the commercial team prioritize launching in Tamil Nadu and Goa immediately, followed by Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, and Delhi within six months. We also suggest monitoring Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra, Punjab, Sikkim, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal for potential future opportunities. Finally, we advise deprioritizing the remaining 15 states due to low commercial viability or disease burden. By focusing on these key markets, our client can maximize its return on investment and effectively enter the Indian diabetes market.\n",
