### Pharma Commercial Intelligence System for India's Diabetes Market

A end-to-end commercial analytics project simulating a consulting engagement
for a pharma company launching a Type-2 diabetes drug across Indian states.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Indian pharma companies spend crores launching diabetes drugs with no systematic
framework for market prioritization, prescriber targeting, or pricing strategy.
This project builds that framework using real public health data.

## 🔍 What This Analyzes
- **Market Landscape** — Which of India's 28 states are priority launch markets?
- **Territory Intelligence** — Where is sales penetration low vs disease burden high?
- **Prescriber Segmentation** — Which doctors drive 80% of prescriptions?
- **Pricing Strategy** — At what price does the drug become inaccessible?
- **Marketing ROI** — Which channel gives the best return on spend?
